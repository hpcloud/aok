# This YAML file tells the AOK authentication system how it will run.

port: 4567 # main port to run AOK on.
strategy:
  # Pick one of the following authetication strategies and fill in all the
  # parameters required by that strategy:
  use: builtin # or ldap
  #------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 1) `builtin` Classic Stackato userid/login strategy.
  #------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # no additional config needed for builtin strategy

  #------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 2) `ldap` Your LDAP server.
  #------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ldap:
    host: localhost
    port: 389
    method: plain # other valid settings are: ssl, tls
    base: 'dc=example, dc=com'
    # uid is the LDAP attribute name for the user name in the login
    # form. Typically AD would be 'sAMAccountName' or 'UserPrincipalName',
    # while OpenLDAP is 'uid'.
    uid: 'sAMAccountName'
    # email is the LDAP attribute containing the user's fully qualified
    # email address. An email address attribute is necessary for AOK to
    # work properly with the cloud controller. This may be a scalar
    # attribute or an array of attributes to search. The default is
    # shown. The first non-null attribute will be used (AOK will not
    # validate that this is an email address).
    email:
     - mail
     - email
     - userPrincipalName
    # Next two are optional. Anonymous access will be used if omitted.
    #bind_dn: 'default_bind_dn' #optional, default credentials for user lookup
    #password: 'password' #optional, default credentials for user lookup

    # Optional. The user with this uid should be given admin privileges.
    # You should have something in order to be able to bootstrap
    # your installation when using LDAP. The user will be granted admin
    # the first time they log in, and will remain an admin if this setting
    # is removed.
    #admin_user: johnDoe

    # name_proc allows you to match the user name entered with the
    # format of the uid attributes. For example, value of
    # 'sAMAccountName' in AD contains only the windows user name.
    # If your user prefers using email to login, a name_proc as below
    # will trim the email string down to just the windows login name.
    # In summary, use name_proc to fill the gap between the submitted
    # username and LDAP uid attribute value. Must be valid ruby code.
    # It is possible to open security holes in Stackato through this
    # setting, since the provided code will be accepting arbitrary user
    # input. Administrators are urged to use this setting only when
    # absolutely necessary, and to check the entered code thoroughly
    # for possible security implications.
    # name_proc: "Proc.new {|name| name.gsub(/@.*$/,'')}" #optional

    # try_sasl and sasl_mechanisms are optional.
    # Use them to initialize a SASL connection to server. If you are not
    # familiar with these authentication methods, please just avoid them.
    # try_sasl: true
    # sasl_mechanisms: DIGEST-MD5 # or GSS-SPNEGO

    # This option will use the user's email address as their username in
    # Stackato, like Stackato 2.x did. This is helpful if importing data
    # and users from Stackato 2.x.
    # use_email_for_username: true

    # group_query and group_attribute are necessary to utilize authn/authz
    # based on LDAP groups in AOK. Specifying group_query will cause AOK to
    # perform an additional search on the LDAP server after a user has
    # successfully authenticated in order to fetch their group membership.
    # %{username} will be replaced with the value of the field specified by
    # uid. %{dn} will be replaced by the dn of the authenticated user. If using
    # this option, you must also specify group_attribute. Set group_query to nil
    # or false to disable this additional query.
    # group_attribute is the LDAP attribute to extract from the entries returned
    # by group_query. Values of this field are what the allowed_groups and
    # admin_groups settings match against.
    # group_query: (&(objectClass=posixGroup)(memberUid=%{username}))
    # group_attribute: cn
    #
    # If group_query and group_attribute are configured, specify the names of groups
    # here that are allowed to access Stackato. This should be an array of string
    # group names.
    # allowed_groups:
    #  - friends
    #  - frenemies
    #
    # If group_query and group_attribute are configured, specify the names of groups
    # whose members should be granted admin privilege. The user will be granted admin
    # the first time they log in while a member of a listed LDAP group, and will
    # remain an admin even if they are later removed from the LDAP group. This
    # should be an array of Strings.
    # admin_groups:
    #  - managers
    #  - sysadmins

  #------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 3) `google` Your "Google Apps for Business" domain
  #------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  google_apps:
    domain: example.com # your company's email domain as used by google apps

# This only dictates what config field gets updated by kato when reconfiguring
# stackato for cluster use. You almost certainly should not change this.
